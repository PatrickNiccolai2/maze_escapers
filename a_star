## How do I determine the value of g and h in the context of our program?

# A* Implementation, f = g + h
def a_star(start_vertex, end_vertex):

    vertices_to_discover = []
    vertices_already_discovered = []

    vertices_to_discover.append(start_vertex)

    while (len(vertices_to_discover) != 0):
        current_vertex = vertices_to_discover[0]

        for each in vertices_to_discover:
            ## Find vertex with smallest f, set as current_vertex
            current_vertex = each
        
        vertices_already_discovered.append(current_vertex)

        if (current_vertex == end_vertex):
            ## Best path found, backtrack from current vertex to start vertex for path
            continue ## Place holder
        else:
            ## Find all adjacent vertices of current_vertex, add to vertices_to_discover.
